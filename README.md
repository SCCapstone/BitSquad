# Screen Time Limiter

The Screen Time Limiter is a web application built using the Angular framework. All users can set up timers and create schedules for gaming applications. Browser notifications alert users when time is up. Windows users can download the desktop app which will kill the specified process automatically when a process reaches its specified limit for the day. Lastly, users can view graphs that show how much time they spent gaming overall, and per application.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first need to install:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

* Check that installation was successful. You should receive a version number after executing each of the these commands:
>* node -v
>* npm -v 

* Make sure npm is up to date:
>* npm install -g npm




## Setup

After cloning the repo, you must add the Angular build kit to the directory where you cloned the project. The build kit is part of node-modules.

ng add node-modules

## Running
To open on localhost port 4200:

ng serve --open

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
